      <h2 style="font-family:helvetica;">Facilitating the cultural integrity of mankind</h2>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Since 1976, Elecoms Archival Corporation has prided itself
          on guaranteeing the preservation of cultural and historic
          mediums. Beginning as a small hardware company in the mid-1970s,
          Electronic Communications Ltd. soon became the world-changing
          and revolutionary corporation it is today.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:helvetica;">Why we archive</h2>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Not for centuries, has humanity posessed the technology and
        capability to destroy itself. The invention of Thermonuclear
        Bombs has not only put the probability of losing billions of
        human lives, but the very foundation of our cultures; History.
        We began in the early 1980's preserving historical commons,
        like critically acclaimed literature, and film. Soon, we
        realized that it would simply not be enough. Our mission
        took us to preserve even more. Historical footage, texts,
        and audio files have all been, with the help of new technology,
        preserved.</p>
        <blockquote><i>"The future is uncertain. The preservation of history,
        shouldn't be."</i></blockquote>
