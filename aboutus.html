<hr>

        <p><b>What do we stand for?</b>
        <p>In simple terms, we stand for you. Our philosophy at Elecoms
           is the conservation of all things to do with humanity. This
           company is essentially a living time capsule.</p>
        <p>Centuries ago, people told their history through only spoken
           means. This proved to be a very terrible form of preserving
           history, and a plethora of important information was lost among
           the ages. So we developed books, a much more efficient method of
           documentation. Books evolved into television, among other
           recorded media. Information is stored throughout the internet,
           all over the world, and we here at Elecoms collect as much of it
           as we can and store it. In this sense, Elecoms is the natural next
           evolutionary step of books.</p>

        <p><b>What does this mean for us?</b></p>
        <p>Elecoms stores all sorts of information, including historical events,
           culturally significant media, and threats to people's lives.
           As we collect more and more information, government funded
           intelligence agencies are free to access our files, and develop
           their defenses accordingly. This ensures that you, the average citizen,
           is well protected against any possible future threats.</p>
